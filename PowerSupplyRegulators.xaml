Switching DC converters provide for high power level applications.

"/><LineBreak/><Run Text="DC-DC PWM Switching converter: "/><LineBreak/><Run Text="      Advantages include low component count, high efficiency, constant frequency operation, ability to achieve high conversion ratio for step-up/step down functionality. The only disadvantage is limited operation        frequency due to the PWM rectangular voltage and current waveforms that generates switching losses. The switch is operated with a duty cycle D , the average value of the output voltage is Vo=DVs. To provide path for a continuous inductor current a diode is connected. If the switch operates with a duty ratio D, the output voltage is a series of pulses of duration (1-D)T with amplitude Vs/(1-D). The value of the filter inductance is determined by L= (1-D)R/2f, so for typical values of D=0.5, R=10ohm and frequency = 100kHz, the inductor is 25uH. For values about 25uH the converter operates in a continuous conduction mode.  The filter inductor current in the CCM consists of a dc component  with a superimposed triangular ac component. Most of this ac component flows through the filter capacitor as a current  ic. Current ic causes a small voltage ripple across the dc output voltage Vo.  To limit the peak-peak value of the ripple voltage for step down converter the filter capacitance must be greater than Cmin = (1-D)Vo/8VrLf2).  For step up converter the filter capacitance that results in a voltage ripple of Vr is given by Cmin = DVo/VrRf.  For a 1% ripple at 50% duty cycle with a load resistance of 10ohm and operating frequency of 100Khz , C = 50uF. The inductor value is given by  (1-D)2 DR/ 2f.

Complex circuitry is required to prevent the switches from being on at the same time and for driving the switches( a low voltage MOSFET ).

In the voltage mode control topology the converter output voltage is sensed and subtracted from an external reference voltage in an error amplifier.   The output voltage is a scaled down version through a resistive voltage divider, this connects to the feedback input of the error amplifier.  The error amplifier has an internal high accuracy reference voltage Vref. The error amplifier is a high gain amplifier and produces a voltage that is connected to a comparator and compared to the  constant amplitude sawtooth waveform. The comparator produces a PWM signal that is connnected to the drivers of the controllable switches(power electronics) in the dc-dc converter. The duty ratio of the PWM signal depends on the  comparator input voltage and hence the output of the error amplifier which depends on the difference between the output voltage and the voltage reference.  The sawtooth waveform generator can be connected to a clock source and hence the ckt can be connected to an external clock source.  The voltage mode provides flexibility, accurate load regulation and is a simple hardware implementation. Any variations in the line regulation (input voltage and reference voltage) is delayed since the changes need to be visible on the output voltage. To compensate for this delay the voltage feedback includes a voltage feedforward path. The feedforward path directly connects the PWM duty ratio to the variations in the input voltage. This is also part of the current mode control scheme. An additional inner control loop connects to the inductor current signal (peak or the average current signal, this can equate to the switching current). This current signal is converted to an voltage signal and hence replaces the constant amplitude sawtooth waveform.  This changes the dynamic behavior of the converter.  Since the output switching current is  proportional to the input voltage, the inner loop of the current mode also provides the functionality of the voltage feedforward technique.  Advantages of the current mode include voltage feedforward and a limit on the peak switch current with the main disadvantage of being the complex hardware that is required to compensate the control voltage by ramp signals, this avoids converter stability.  The hysteric control bypasses the error amplifier and connects the feedback output voltage directly to a comparator with an internal reference voltage. It is the less expensive and has an immediate reaction to any output voltage changes at transient.  The main disadvantage is that the switching frequency is set by the hysteretic amount versus being synchronized to an external clock source.   PMIC include an error amplifier, comparator, sawtooth generator, sensed current input latch and PWM drivers. The switching frequency is set by an external RC network.  The controller also has an oscillator that can be connected to other oscillator outputs for synchronizations. Power up and power down sequencing can be managed through an I/O interface such as an I2C bus. The ASIC (PMIC) controller can include various diagnostic and protection features such as over voltage and undervoltage protection, soft start, dead time in case of PWM outputs, duty ratio limiting."
