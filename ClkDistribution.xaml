An increase in phase error controls the VCO to converge and minimize the phase error.  At every rising edge of the reference frequency (which can be generated by an oscillator)  the phase comparison by the phase detector occurs. The output of the phase detector produces a pulsed error voltage whose pulse width is equal to the difference in the phases of the two signals. The low pass filter processes the pulsed error voltage to create a dc voltage for the VCO.

A common application is the multiplication of the reference frequency, this is accomplished by placing a frequency divider in the feedback path of the loop.  Critical design considerations include timing jitter, loop stability, noise immunity and architecture. The sensitivity of the PLL to noise on the supply, jitter on the output , phase noise and frequency tuning range width, linear modulation depends on the characteristics of he VCO.
