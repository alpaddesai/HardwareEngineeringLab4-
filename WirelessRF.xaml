                    <Run Text="A mixer is a 3 port device that achieves frequency conversion by using a time varying element.  The ideal mixer will produce an output signal that consists of the sum and difference of its two input signals.  It is usually based on nonlinearity provided by either a diode or a transistor. These devices are utilized in  modern microwave systems to perform the functions of frequency up conversion and down conversion between baseband signal frequencies and RF carrier frequencies. The RF and LO frequencies are similar hence the output is twice the RF and the difference is much smaller than RF frequency. Since non-linearities are present, the mixer produces many more products hence these products re removed by filtering. In a receiver the RF input signal is delivered from the antenna the second port with matching impedance can be a local oscillator (LO) and a possible third matching impedance port at intermediate frequency (IF) the RF input frequency will be down converted to the IF frequency as Frf = Flo + Fif , this is called the image response and Fim = Flo-Fif.     Since there are inherent losses in the frequency conversion process due to the generation of undesired harmonics , a key criteria for the mixer device is the conversion loss ratio which is defined as the ratio of available RF input power to the available IF output power: Lc = 10log RF input power/ IF output power &gt;= 0db."/>

                    <Run NumberSubstitution.CultureSource="User" Text="Stability, gain and noise metrics are the critical elements to selecting or designing the RF amplifier. An ideal amplifier would have constant gain and good input matching over the desired frequency bandwidth. Usually an improvement in bandwidth is achieved a the cost of gain due to the microwave transistors not being matched to 50ohm, hence S21 decreases with frequency at the rate of 6db/Octave. To limit these trade-offs the input and output matching sections of the amplifier can be designed to to compensate for the gain rolloff in [S21] however this increases the noise figure. Another solution can be negative feedback which is utilized to flatten the gain response of the transistor hence improving the input/output matching networks and improving stability. Differential amplifiers are the ideal choice which provides a large output voltage and a high common mode rejection ratio.  Distributed amplifiers have several transistors cascaded together providing a good gain, matching and noise figure (measure of the degradation of the signal to noise ratio between the input and output component F = Si/Ni  divided by So/No , in a noisy network there will be a difference such that F&gt;=1)   over a stable bandwidth.  The balanced amplifier can  be designed with two couplers to cancel the input and output reflections from two identical amplifiers."/>

                    <Run NumberSubstitution.CultureSource="User" Text="Information may be impressed upon a sinusoidal carrier using amplitude, frequency or phase modulation.  For modulating signals that present digital data in binary form, the variation in amplitude, frequency and phase of the carrier will be limited to two values, these types of modulations are considered amplitude shift keying, frequency shift keying and phase shift keying.  For an AM or FM radio, the modulating signal is analog hence the amplitude, frequency and phase of the carrier will undergo a continuous variation. Modern wireless systems rely on digital modulation methods due to their advantages over other methods in providing performance over the presence of noise and signal fading. These are also better suited for transmission of data with error correcting codes or encryption."/>

                    <Run NumberSubstitution.CultureSource="User" Text="An antenna converts a guided EM wave on a  transmission line into a plane wave propagating in free space is called a transmitting antenna. A receiving antenna interfaces with the propagating plane wave and delivers a power Pr to the receiver load impedance. Various antenna categories include Wire antennas (dipole, monopole, loop, sleeve, Yagi-Uda arrays), aperture antenna, printed antenna and array antenna.  The wire antenna's have low gain and are utilized in the HF to UHF frequencies, aperture antenna have moderate gain and are utilized at the uwave and mm wave frequencies. Printed antennas include the printed slots, printed dipoles ad microstrip patch antennas.  Most often used at uwave and mm wave frequencies.  Array antenna is a rectangular arrangement of antenna elements with a feeding network. For patch antenna the the feed circuitry is fabricated on dielectric substrates. The beam  angle and sidelobe levels can be controlled by adjusting the amplitude and phase excitation of the array elements.  A fundamental property of an antenna is its ability to focus power in a given direction to the exclusion of other directions.  An antenna with  broad main  beam can transmit or receive power over a wide angular region, while an antenna with a narrow beam will transmit (or receive) power over a small angular region.  A measure of this focusing effect is the angular width of the main beam at which the power level dropped 3db from it's maximum value.  Antennas with a constant radiation pattern ( just the plot of the magnitude of the far zone field strength versus the position around the antenna at a fixed distance from the antenna) in the azimuthal plane ( radiation pattern is plotted from the pattern function F(theta,phi) versus either theta (elevation plane) or phi (azimuthal plane pattern)) are called omnidirectional and useful for applications in broadcasting or for  hand held wireless devices.  Radiation patterns with narrow main beams in both planes are known as pencil beam antennas are useful in applications such as radar and point to point radio links.  Directivity of an antenna is defined as the ratio of the maximum  radiation intensity in the main beam to the average radiation intensity overall space. It is a dimensionless ratio of power and is expressed in db as D(dB) = 10log(D) ( examples 2.2db for a wire dipole, 7db for a microstrip patch antenna , 23db for a waveguide horn antenna) An isotropic antenna radiates equally in all directions.   An antenna pattern with a narrow main beam will have  a high directivity while a pattern with a wide beam will have a lower directivity.  However there is no direct relationship, since directivity involves the integration of the radiation pattern while beamwidth depends on the size and shape of the main beam. Radiation efficiency is defined as the  ratio of the desired output power to the supplied input power.  Antenna gain is the product of directivity and efficiency. "/>

Examples of aperature antennas are reflector antennas, horn antennas, lens and array antennas. The maximum directivity can be obtained from a large aperature area (Dmax  4piA/ lamdasq) . Aperature efficiency is defined as the ratio of the actual directivity of an aperature antenna to the maximum directivity of an aperature antenna."/>

                    <Run NumberSubstitution.CultureSource="User" Text="Radar or radio detecting and ranging is one of the oldest applications of microwave technoloygy.  When a transmitter sends out a signal it is partly reflected by  distant target and then received by a sensitive receiver.  The target's direction can be given by the angular position of a narrow beam antenna.  The distance from the target to the antenna can be determined by the time required for a pulsed signal to travel to the target and back.Hence a pulse radar determines the target range by measuring the round trip time of a pulsed microwave signal.  The doppler shift can be used to separate its pulse doppler radar return from clutter which is stationary relative to the radar.  For ex. if the target has a velocity component (it's not stationary) along the line of sight of the radar the returned signal will be shifted in frequency relative to the transmitted frequency due to the Doppler effect. If the transmitted frequency is fo and the radial target velocity is v then the shift in frequency or the Doppler frequency will be fd = 2vfo/c .  Hence in a doppler radar system, the filter following the mixer should have a passband corresponding to the expected minimum and maximum target velocities. "/>
